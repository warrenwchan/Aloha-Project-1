#Project 1(a) - Web Development

The Aloha project required us to develop a web page for the Aloha Apparel Co.
The web page includes the company's top selling products along with product images,
descriptions, and prices. The web page also includes subscription form, contact
info and social media links.

The webpage was developed using the following tools and technologies:
HTML
CSS
Atom - Text Editor
Google Chrome Dev. Tools
Terminal
